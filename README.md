This article is submitted to a journal and under review. The more detailed information will be further updated once it is accepted.

## Empirical Data Analysis
The data that support the findings of this study are openly available at [TIMSS 2019 International Database](https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2019/international-database)

## Simulation Studies
Data is partially generated to reflect a real hierarchical data structures of large-scale assessment data in education. Specifically, the 2019 TIMSS data are used to generate simulated values of the response variable using two-level models, while the predictors and their values remain intact.
